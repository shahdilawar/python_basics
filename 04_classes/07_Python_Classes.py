'''
Create a Bank account class. Be sure to build the logic so that users 
cannot withdraw more money than they have in the account. Each bank account 
should have the following attributes and methods.
* A unique account number â€” this can be assigned sequentially.
* A balance instantiated with an opening deposit.
* A method for depositing money.
* A method for withdrawing money.
* A method that prints the account balance.
