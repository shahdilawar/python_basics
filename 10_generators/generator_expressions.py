'''
Building generators with generator expressions
* Generator expressions allow you to quickly create a generator object 
  in just a few lines of code.
* you can create them without building and holding the entire object 
    in memory before iteration.
* If speed is an issue and memory isnâ€™t, then a list comprehension is 
    likely a better tool for the job
